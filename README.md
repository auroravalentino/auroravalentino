usually sitting in between the cookie run and idol and rhythm games areas if you need to find me ... usually also playing something else or making skins and running pt on my laptop. whisper if you need anything

main interests are cookie run, persona 2/3/4 i HATE 5 dont talk to me about it, metaphor, soulsborne, code vein, akuma no riddle, etc etc ask me for others. i dabble in genshin solely for the 4 characters ive been attached to at the hip for the last 2-4 years; i dont actually play anymore
