constantly editing this i need stuff to do

usually sitting in between the cookie run and idol and rhythm games areas if you need to find me ... usually also playing something else or making skins and running pt on my laptop. whisper if you need anything

main interests are cookie run, persona 2/3/4 i HATE 5 dont talk to me about it (/j its just the game with the story that i liked the least), metaphor, soulsborne, code vein, akuma no riddle, etc etc ask me for others. i dabble in genshin solely for the 4 characters ive been attached to at the hip for the last 2-4 years; i dont actually play anymore

favs, bolded are the ones im REALLY fucking annoying about sorry
**pastry**, snake fruit, licorice, **scorpion**, sour belt, madeleine, wind archer (cr)

yukino (1 and 2 imagine making a character so good shes peak twice), basically all of the persona 2 cast for both games LAWL, emphasis on tatsuya, jun, sudou, **anna**, and junko i think about them the most, shinji, minato, aigis, yukari, toriumi/yko (sorry) (i could fix her), **metis**, **jin**, **izumi**, the rest of strega i guess ðŸ˜’, yosuke, yukiko, marie (theres probably more i havent played p4 in forever sorry) (persona) 

everyone. again. emphasis on will, heismay, **alonzo**, bardon, louis, **zorba**, glodell (metaphor) 

there are SO many souls characters i like but the super important ones are ciaran, isshin, and midra. cdvn characters i like are yakumo shinonome, karen amamiya, aurora valentino, cruz silva. going here cause theyre soulsy enough and i actually dont like enough soulslikes to warrant its own section even though ive played like 80% of em

genshin characters i care about are diluc, jeht, wrio, and capitano if you were curious
